Frontend of Slidely Task-2  :  

Form1 - Main interface of the application containing CreateSubmission and ViewSubmission Buttons (The shortcuts Work :) )


CreateSubmissionsForm - Where you can create submission CTRL+T to toggle stopwatch or just click the button and then fill all the required fields and click submit.


ViewSubmissionsForm - Where you can view all the submissions made and you can also toggle them using Previous and Next Buttons

In the view submissions form I've added the options of deleting and editing the form

I was unable to implement Search form by emails
